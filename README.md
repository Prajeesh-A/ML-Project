# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Colab Notebook

This repository contains a Colab notebook showcasing the application of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset. The notebook walks through various EDA techniques to explore, analyze, and visualize data.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Importing datasets from local or online sources.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
- **Data Exploration**:
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Summary of dataset features
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
  - Correlation matrices and heatmaps
  - Distribution plots, box plots, and scatter plots
- **Insights Extraction**:
  - Highlighting key patterns and relationships in the dataset.
